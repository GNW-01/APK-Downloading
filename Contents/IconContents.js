        "1": "Qualitative Findings: User Psychology & Perceptions\n\nJustification & Rationalization of Piracy\n\nðŸ“Œ Finding from the Study:\nUsers donâ€™t always see piracy as wrong, especially when apps are expensive or unavailable in their region.\n\nðŸ”¹ Chin et al. (2021) found that users justify piracy as a necessary alternative when official versions are inaccessible.\n\nðŸ“Œ What This Means:\nâœ” Users believe piracy is a workaround for unfair restrictions.\nâœ” Some rationalize it by claiming companies already make enough money.\n\nðŸš¨ The Reality:\nðŸ”¸ Piracy undermines the business models of developers, forcing them to adopt more restrictive monetization practices.\n\nâœ… Solution:\nDevelopers should provide affordable, accessible alternatives such as regional pricing and freemium models.",
        "2": "Qualitative Findings: User Psychology & Perceptions\n\nPerceived Security of Unauthorized Apps\n\nðŸ“Œ Finding from the Study:\nUsers assume some piracy sources are safe because they have not experienced security issues.\n\nðŸ”¹ De Leon et al. (2021) found that many MOD APKs contain hidden malware, exposing users to serious risks.\n\nðŸ“Œ What This Means:\nâœ” Users feel a false sense of security when using \"trusted\" piracy sources.\n\nðŸš¨ The Reality:\nðŸ”¸ Even \"safe\" sources can embed spyware that activates later.\nðŸ”¸ Users unknowingly compromise personal data and financial accounts\n\nâœ… Solution:\nRaising cybersecurity awareness about how hackers exploit APK piracy can help users avoid unsafe downloads.",
        "3": "Qualitative Findings: User Psychology & Perceptions\n\nAnti-Piracy Efforts vs. Workarounds\n\nðŸ“Œ Finding from the Study:\nDespite anti-piracy laws and security measures, users find workarounds to continue piracy.\n\nðŸ”¹ Li, Liao, & Xie (2021) found that piracy constantly evolves alongside security measures.\n\nðŸ“Œ What This Means:\nâœ” Anti-piracy measures are often temporary solutions, as users find ways to bypass them.\n\nðŸš¨ The Reality:\nðŸ”¸ Digital piracy is an ever-evolving problem requiring continuous monitoring and stricter enforcement.\n\nâœ… Solution:\nStrengthening app security and piracy detection systems can help prevent APK modifications.",
